            <p>Liang Qichao's Former Residence features a blend of Chinese and Western architectural styles, reflecting the cultural exchanges of the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
            
            <p>A huge restoration in the site was seen to maintain its architectural integrity and preserve artifacts that reflect Liang's life and contributions. In addition, the residence often hosts events, lectures, and exhibitions to educate visitors about Liang Qichao's impact on Chinese society and political thought.</p>
