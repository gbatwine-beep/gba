            <p>The Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence Memorial Museum was located in Cuihang Village (翠亨村) in Zhongshan.</p>

            <p>Sun Yat-sen (1866 - 1925) is a highly significant figure in modern Chinese history. He is often honored as the "Father of the Nation" (國父) and plays a crucial transitional role in modern Chinese history, connecting China's imperial past with its path toward modernization. He led the Xinhai Revolution, which resulted in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China.</p>
            
            <img src="https://imgur.com/ZFJbxZI.jpg" alt="Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence Memorial Museum">
            
            <p>Sun Yat-sen's Former Residence Memorial Museum is not only a National First-Class Museum (國家一級博物館) and a 5A-rated tourist attraction (國家5A級旅遊景區), but also the core scenic area of the Sun Yat-sen's Hometown Tourism Zone (孫中山故里旅遊區). It was an area that Sun Yat-sen spent his childhood here, where his revolutionary ideas first took shape. Visitors can explore the well-preserved interiors, including his study, kitchen, and courtyard well, which offer a glimpse into his daily life. The museum also exhibits artifacts and documents detailing his life and revolutionary journey.</p>

            <p>The museum was built with funds provided by Sun Yat-sen's elder brother, Sun Mei (孫眉). This two-story building combines brick-and-wood construction with a fusion of Chinese and Western architectural styles. Its ochre-red exterior walls (赭紅色外牆), blending traditional Lingnan residential design (嶺南民居) with Western-style arcades (拱廊), attract visitors' attention and invite them to explore its rich cultural heritage.</p>
            
            <p>As the museum is situated within a historic village, it enables visitors to experience the lifestyle and culture of Cuihang Village during the late Qing and early Republican era (清末民初), offering an enriching sense of historical immersion.</p>
